# MongoDB Integration Complete! ✅

Your e-commerce store is now integrated with MongoDB Atlas. Follow these steps to complete the setup.

## 📋 What's Been Done

✅ **MongoDB connection utility** created (`lib/mongodb.ts`)
✅ **Mongoose models** created:
  - `models/Product.ts` - Product schema
  - `models/Order.ts` - Order schema
✅ **API routes updated** to use MongoDB
✅ **Products store** now uses database
✅ **Data seeding script** created
✅ **Dependencies installed**: mongodb, mongoose, tsx

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your MongoDB Connection String

You need to add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to your environment variables.

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name:** `MONGODB_URI`
   - **Value:** `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/ecommerce?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
4. Click "Save"
5. Redeploy your app

**For Local Development:**

Update your `.env` file:

```env
# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=v9U9QKqmpKvquVC+tAIdnPeD4MhwpCn112AwkCw0TiA=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# MongoDB - Add this line with your connection string
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/ecommerce?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 2. Seed Your Database

Once you have added `MONGODB_URI` to your `.env` file, run:

```bash
pnpm run seed
```

This will:
- Connect to your MongoDB database
- Clear any existing products
- Insert all 18 gaming products
- Show you what was seeded

**Expected output:**
```
Connecting to MongoDB...
Connected!
Clearing existing products...
Products cleared!
Seeding products...
✅ Successfully seeded 18 products!

Seeded Products:
1. Predator Helios Gaming Laptop - ₱1899 (laptops)
2. ROG Strix Gaming Laptop - ₱2299 (laptops)
...
18. Herman Miller X Logitech Vantum - ₱995 (chairs)

Database connection closed.
```

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and:
- ✅ Homepage should load products from MongoDB
- ✅ Login as admin: admin@example.com / password
- ✅ Go to Admin Panel → Add/Edit/Delete products
- ✅ Changes persist in MongoDB!

### 4. Redeploy to Vercel

After adding `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in Vercel:

**Option A: Auto-deploy**
- Push changes to GitHub
- Vercel automatically deploys

**Option B: Manual deploy**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Seed Production Database

After deployment, seed your production database:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to "Deployments" → Latest deployment
4. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
5. Or run seed script locally with production MONGODB_URI

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Files:
- `lib/mongodb.ts` - MongoDB connection with caching
- `models/Product.ts` - Product Mongoose model
- `models/Order.ts` - Order Mongoose model
- `scripts/seed.ts` - Database seeding script

### Updated Files:
- `lib/products-store.ts` - Now uses MongoDB
- `app/api/orders/route.ts` - Now uses MongoDB
- `app/api/products/route.ts` - Already configured
- `app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` - Already configured
- `package.json` - Added seed script

## 🎯 How It Works

### Connection Pooling
```typescript
// Reuses connections across requests
let cached = global.mongoose
if (cached.conn) return cached.conn
```

### Product Operations

**Get all products:**
```typescript
const products = await getAllProducts()
// Returns all products from MongoDB
```

**Add product (Admin):**
```typescript
const newProduct = await addProduct({
  name: "New Gaming Mouse",
  price: 99.99,
  category: "mice",
  // ...
})
```

**Update product (Admin):**
```typescript
const updated = await updateProduct(productId, {
  price: 79.99,
  stock: 100
})
```

**Delete product (Admin):**
```typescript
const success = await deleteProduct(productId)
```

### Order Operations

**Create order:**
```typescript
const order = await Order.create({
  orderNumber: "ORD-123...",
  customerInfo: {...},
  items: [...],
  paymentMethod: "gcash",
  total: 1299.99
})
```

## 🔒 Security

### Environment Variables
- ✅ MONGODB_URI is secret (not in git)
- ✅ Connection string includes authentication
- ✅ Network access restricted (or open for Vercel)

### API Security
- ✅ Public: GET products (anyone can view)
- ✅ Protected: POST/PUT/DELETE products (admin only)
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ Role verification

## 📊 MongoDB Atlas Dashboard

Access your database:
1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Login to your account
3. Select your cluster
4. Click "Collections" to view data

### Collections:
- **products** - All your gaming products
- **orders** - Customer orders
- **users** (optional) - User accounts

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to MongoDB"

**Check:**
1. MONGODB_URI is correct
2. Password doesn't contain special characters (URL encode if needed)
3. IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0
4. Database name is specified in connection string

### "No products showing"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run seed script
pnpm run seed
```

### "Seeding fails"

**Check:**
1. MONGODB_URI is in .env
2. Connection string is correct
3. Database user has write permissions
4. Network access allows your IP

### "Products not persisting"

**Check:**
1. Using correct MONGODB_URI (not old in-memory store)
2. Admin is authenticated
3. Check Vercel logs for errors
4. Verify API routes are working

## 📈 Scaling

### Free Tier Limits:
- 512MB storage
- ~500 products with images
- 1000s of orders
- Shared CPU

### When to Upgrade (M10+ ~$57/month):
- More than 1GB data
- High traffic (>100 concurrent users)
- Need automated backups
- Need dedicated resources
- Want better performance

## 🎉 Success!

Your e-commerce store is now:
✅ **Connected to MongoDB Atlas**
✅ **Persistent data storage**
✅ **Real-time product updates**
✅ **Production-ready**
✅ **Scalable**

## Next Steps
